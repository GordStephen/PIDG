## (start of) readme for how to use PSSE2PLEXOS submodule
updated March 24, 2016

---

Run PSSE2PLEXOS submodule by running the script run_PSSE2PLEXOS.R.

To run_PSSE2PLEXOS.R, pass in four arguments, either as command line arguments
or by modifying the definition of these variables in this script (and creating
the variable 'args'): 

1. path to directory of PSSE2PLEXOS master script
2. path to input parameters file
3. path to directory containing input files
4. path to directory into which output excel doc should be saved

An example of an input parameters file is in this directory. This is where
pointers to the PSSE file, generator to fuel mapping, definition of any
properties, models, etc. are set, as well as where the name of the excel 
workbook to be exported is defined.

We'll clean up this example soon and add example input files as well.
